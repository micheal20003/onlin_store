         <h2>What is TRX?</h2>
         <p>TRX exercises are a dynamic form of suspension training that uses adjustable straps and your body weight to perform a wide range of movements. 
            Originally developed by a Navy SEAL, TRX training is designed to improve strength, balance, flexibility, and core stability—all without the need for bulky gym equipment.
             Whether you're just starting your fitness journey or looking to add variety to your workouts, TRX offers scalable exercises that adapt to your fitness level. By leveraging gravity and your body’s own resistance, TRX helps you engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously, making your training both efficient and effective.</p>
